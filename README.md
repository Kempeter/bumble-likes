<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I used Bumble for a while and became curious about who liked me. I discovered Bumble Web and realized I could access the right data.<br><br>
The green dot (ðŸŸ¢) means, that the user liked you.<br>
The program will download the users pictures automatically.<br>
Example:
<table border-collapse: collapse>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>
